# CloudStack OS Templates Automation Project Plan

## Project Overview
Automated system for building multiple OS templates (Ubuntu, AlmaLinux, RockyLinux, CentOS, SUSE, RedHat, Fedora) for CloudStack infrastructure. This project will create standardized, reusable VM templates that can be deployed across CloudStack environments.

## Target Operating Systems
- Ubuntu (LTS versions)
- AlmaLinux
- RockyLinux
- CentOS
- SUSE Linux Enterprise
- Red Hat Enterprise Linux
- Fedora

## Current Status
- **CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL FINDING**: M1 Mac incompatibility with x86 virtualization requires cloud-native build approach
- Project foundation and OS templates completed (Phases 1-3)
- **ARCHITECTURE DECISION**: Migration to GitHub Actions-based builds required for cross-platform compatibility

## Key CloudStack Template Requirements
Based on CloudStack documentation:
- Templates must include hypervisor-specific tools (XenServer PV drivers, VMware Tools)
- System preparation includes OS updates, network configuration, hostname management
- Template cleanup: remove unique identifiers, log files, user history
- Optional password reset capability for instance deployment
- Support for VHD, OVA, and other hypervisor-specific formats
- Templates can be uploaded via HTTP server, local upload, or converted from existing instances

## Technical Approach
### Current Architecture (Local - INCOMPATIBLE with M1 Mac)
- ~~Use Packer for automated OS template building~~ (Requires x86 virtualization)
- ~~Local QEMU/KVM execution~~ (Not available on M1 Mac)

### New Architecture (Cloud-Native - REQUIRED)
- **GitHub Actions with x86 runners** for Packer execution
- **Matrix build strategy** for parallel OS template creation
- **Cloud artifact storage** (GitHub Packages + S3-compatible)
- **GitOps configuration management** with validation gates
- **Infrastructure as Code** approach for reproducible builds
- Implement standardized post-installation scripts for each OS
- Create consistent networking and security configurations
- Automate CloudStack template registration and deployment
- Following simplicity principle - each task should be minimal and focused

## Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

### ADR-001: Migration to Cloud-Native Build Architecture

**Status**: APPROVED  
**Date**: 2025-01-05  
**Context**: M1 Mac hardware incompatibility with x86 virtualization requirements

#### Problem Statement
The current local build architecture assumes x86 virtualization capabilities (QEMU/KVM) that are not available on Apple Silicon (M1/M2) hardware. This creates a fundamental blocker for template development and testing on modern Mac hardware.

#### Decision
Migrate from local Packer builds to cloud-native GitHub Actions-based template building with x86 runners.

#### Consequences
**Positive:**
- Cross-platform compatibility for all development environments
- Scalable, parallel builds through matrix strategy
- Version-controlled, auditable build process
- Professional CI/CD practices implementation
- Cost-effective scaling with usage-based pricing

**Negative:**
- Dependency on cloud infrastructure for all builds
- GitHub Actions usage costs (mitigated by self-hosted runners)
- Increased complexity in local development workflow
- Network dependency for build operations

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Phase 4a**: GitHub Actions foundation with single OS proof-of-concept
2. **Phase 4b**: Matrix builds for all 5 OS templates
3. **Phase 4c**: CloudStack integration and deployment automation
4. **Phase 4d**: Production hardening and monitoring

#### Alternatives Considered
- **Docker-based local builds**: Still requires x86 emulation on M1
- **Remote development environments**: Higher cost, slower iteration
- **Platform restriction**: Limits team to x86 hardware only

#### Success Criteria
- All OS templates buildable in GitHub Actions
- Build success rate >95%
- Average build time <30 minutes per template
- Total cost <$50/month for regular development usage

## SSH Hanging Issue Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

### Problem Analysis
- **Issue Identified**: AlmaLinux, Fedora, and Rocky Linux builds were hanging at "Waiting for SSH to become available"
- **Root Cause**: SSH service wasn't starting properly or quickly enough after OS installation
- **Log Analysis**: All three distributions showed the same hanging point in their respective log files

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Packer Configuration Updates
- **Increased SSH timeout** from 20m to 30m in all three Packer configs
- **Added SSH handshake attempts** (100 attempts) for better retry logic
- **Enabled SSH PTY** for better compatibility
- **Increased boot wait time** from 10s to 15s to allow more time for OS initialization

#### 2. Kickstart Configuration Updates
- **AlmaLinux**: Added SSH daemon configuration and startup commands
- **Fedora**: Enhanced SSH daemon configuration with DNS lookup disabled
- **Rocky Linux**: Enhanced SSH daemon configuration with DNS lookup disabled

#### 3. SSH Service Improvements
- **Explicit SSH enablement**: Added `systemctl enable sshd` and `systemctl start sshd`
- **DNS lookup disabled**: Added `UseDNS no` to prevent DNS resolution delays
- **Root login enabled**: Configured `PermitRootLogin yes` for Packer access
- **Password authentication**: Ensured `PasswordAuthentication yes` is set

### Files Modified
- `templates/almalinux/almalinux.pkr.hcl`
- `templates/fedora/fedora.pkr.hcl`
- `templates/rockylinux/rockylinux.pkr.hcl`
- `templates/almalinux/http/ks.cfg`
- `templates/fedora/http/ks.cfg`
- `templates/rockylinux/http/ks.cfg`

### Changes Summary
1. **SSH Timeout**: Increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes
2. **SSH Handshake**: Added 100 retry attempts
3. **SSH PTY**: Enabled for better terminal compatibility
4. **Boot Wait**: Increased from 10s to 15s
5. **DNS Lookups**: Disabled to prevent delays
6. **SSH Service**: Explicitly enabled and started in post-install

## Ubuntu and CentOS Issues Fix - COMPLETED âœ…

### Ubuntu Checksum Error
- **Problem**: Ubuntu Packer config had placeholder checksum `"placeholder-checksum-will-be-logged-during-build"` which caused invalid hex error
- **Solution**: Updated with actual checksum `"e8ab4cebf62713f3b32a4248375573cf5f8da21d078d423974d47d14f6e10c8c"`
- **Additional**: Applied SSH timeout improvements (30m timeout, 100 handshake attempts, SSH PTY)

### CentOS Configuration
- **Analysis**: CentOS empty log indicates the build may not have been triggered or failed early
- **Solution**: Applied SSH improvements to CentOS Packer and kickstart configs
- **Enhancement**: Added explicit SSH service enablement in kickstart post-install

### Files Modified
- `templates/ubuntu/ubuntu.pkr.hcl` - Fixed checksum and SSH settings
- `templates/ubuntu/http/user-data` - Enhanced SSH configuration in autoinstall
- `templates/centos/centos.pkr.hcl` - Added SSH timeout improvements
- `templates/centos/http/ks.cfg` - Added SSH service configuration

### Implementation Notes

#### Critical Architectural Constraints
- **M1 Mac Incompatibility**: Local Packer/QEMU builds impossible due to x86 virtualization requirements
- **Cloud-First Mandate**: All template builds must execute on x86 infrastructure (GitHub Actions or self-hosted)
- **Cost Considerations**: GitHub Actions usage limits require optimization and potentially self-hosted runners

#### Technical Debt and Migration Requirements
- **Local Build System**: Current BaseTemplateBuilder class needs complete refactoring for cloud execution
- **Path Resolution**: Local file path assumptions invalid in cloud environment
- **Configuration Management**: Need GitOps approach for template configurations
- **Artifact Storage**: Local output incompatible with distributed cloud builds

#### OS-Specific Status
- **Ubuntu**: Template created, autoinstall debugging needed in cloud environment
- **RHEL-based** (AlmaLinux, RockyLinux, CentOS, Fedora): Consistent kickstart approach, cloud-ready
- **SUSE/RedHat**: Licensing/subscription considerations for cloud builds
- **CloudStack Integration**: Scripts standardized but need cloud deployment pipeline

#### Infrastructure Requirements
- **x86 Runners**: Self-hosted or GitHub-hosted with KVM/virtualization support
- **Storage**: Artifact versioning, ISO caching, template distribution
- **Networking**: Secure template upload to CloudStack environments
- **Monitoring**: Build success rates, costs, performance metrics

#### Risk Mitigation
- **Vendor Lock-in**: GitHub Actions dependency managed through standardized workflows
- **Cost Control**: Build optimization, caching strategies, usage monitoring
- **Security**: Template scanning, access controls, audit logging
- **Reliability**: Multi-runner pools, failure recovery, rollback capabilities
